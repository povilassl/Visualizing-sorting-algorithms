# Visualizing different sorting algorithms with p5.js

Done so far:

- Durstenfeld Shuffle
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Coctail Sort
- Gnome Sort
- Merge Sort
- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort
- Quick Sort

TODO:

- Quick sort ret looks too low
- Update display of buttons / info
- Check if there are better ways of handling delay
- Move all delays to global.delay?
- Recolor accessed elements? for indication of process when nothing is replaced
- better way of implementing function execution blocks?
- Check if I'm doing array access and comparisons correctly
- Maybe add array of strings visualizations? would work for radix sort ([asd, adsasd, ddsad, ...)
