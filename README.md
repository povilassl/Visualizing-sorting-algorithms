# Visualizing different sorting algorithms with p5.js

Done so far:

- Durstenfeld Shuffle
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Coctail Sort

TODO:

- Better logic for drawing lines?
- Blocking of multiple processes at the same time
- Update display of buttons / info
- Check if there are better ways of handling delay
- more compact way of adding sorts?
